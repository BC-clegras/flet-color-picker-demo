### Introduction

This is a simple color picker demo based on @ndokoHenri's [color browser](https://github.com/ndonkoHenri/Flet-Color-Browser). The user can click on any color in the browser to change the background color and add that color to the gradient in the little square in the top left.

### Requirements

This just needs [Python 3](https://www.python.org/downloads/) and a recent version of [Flet](https://flet.dev/) (this was developed with version 0.8.1, but earlier/later versions would probably work too).

### How to run the app

Once you have Python and Flet installed, simply download the code and execute `main.py`. The window should pop up and you can click away at colors as much as you want!
